# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms but not the most efficient.

This repository contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in [programming language], along with explanations and examples of how it works.

## Getting Started

To get started with this implementation, you'll need [programming language] installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can download it from [official website].

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bubble-sort.git
```

### Prerequisites

- [programming language] [version]
- [Additional dependencies, if any]

## Usage

You can use the Bubble Sort algorithm by including the `bubble_sort.py` file in your project. Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```python
from bubble_sort import bubble_sort

my_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

# Sort the list
bubble_sort(my_list)

print("Sorted list:", my_list)
```

## Algorithm Description

Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
procedure bubble sort(arr: list)
    n = length(arr)
    do
        swapped = false
        for i from 1 to n-1
            if arr[i-1] > arr[i]
                swap(arr[i-1], arr[i])
                swapped = true
        end for
        n = n - 1
    while swapped
end procedure
```

## Examples

In the `examples` directory, you will find some example programs that demonstrate how to use the Bubble Sort algorithm. These examples include sorting lists of numbers, strings, and custom objects.
